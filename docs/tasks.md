# Racing Pointsheet Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvement tasks for the Racing Pointsheet application. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Implement proper environment configuration management

  - [ ] Move hardcoded configuration values from `create_app()` to environment variables
  - [ ] Create separate configuration classes for different environments (dev, test, prod)
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded SECRET_KEY from the code

- [ ] Improve project structure

  - [ ] Standardize module organization across the codebase
  - [ ] Consolidate duplicate model definitions (domain vs database models)
  - [ ] Create clear separation between API, domain logic, and data access layers

- [ ] Implement proper error handling
  - [ ] Add global exception handler for all API endpoints
  - [ ] Standardize error response format
  - [ ] Add logging for all exceptions

## Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] Fix bugs and code issues

  - [ ] Fix the variable reference in `get_events()` function (line 33 in api/events/events.py)
  - [ ] Fix type inconsistency in Track model (length is int in domain model but string in DB model)
  - [ ] Complete the implementation of `home_race_cards()` function in views/home.py
  - [ ] Remove debug print statements (e.g., in ongoing_events function)

- [ ] Improve code maintainability

  - [ ] Add type hints consistently across the codebase
  - [ ] Refactor complex functions (e.g., validation error handling in **init**.py)
  - [ ] Apply consistent naming conventions for variables and functions

- [ ] Enhance security
  - [ ] Implement proper input validation for all API endpoints
  - [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
  - [ ] Review and secure file upload functionality
